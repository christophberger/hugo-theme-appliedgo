Hugo theme "AppliedGo"
======================

This theme is specifically taylored for appliedgo.net. Large parts of it were copied from [hugo-icarus-theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-icarus).

The theme is not suitable (yet) for general use; hence this readme does not provide any instructions for installation or setup; this is intentional.
